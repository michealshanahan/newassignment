        <p class="centerPage"> As of Friday's edition, the nameplate of daily Postimees now features the slogan "We stand for the preservation of the Estonian people,
            language and culture through the ages."
            "This phrase refers to the Estonian Constitution," Postimees editor-in-chief Peeter Helme explained. "More specifically, to the latest, 2007 wording of its preamble." A nameplate is a stylized banner on the front of a newsletter or other periodical that identifies the publication. 
            The nameplate usually contains the name of the newsletter, possibly graphics or a logo, and sometimes a subtitle, 
            motto, or other publication information. The nameplate communicates the identity of the publication and makes it easily recognizable.
            Although usually found horizontally across the top of the front page, vertical nameplates are not uncommon. The nameplate provides a visual identity for the newsletter and, except for 
            a dateline or issue number, is usually the same from issue to issue. However, variations are not unheard of, such as making color changes or adding graphic embellishments to match the theme of the issue.

        <p class="sidePage leftSide">Previous versions of the paper's nameplate have included the slogan "Estonian daily" and, in the early 1990s, "Tartu daily." Recently, 
            however, the nameplate has not included a slogan at all.
            "As of the beginning of this year, the name of the company publishing Postimees is AS Postimees Grupp," Helme noted. 
            "The name change was motivated by a desire to tie the company to our 
            flagship newspaper, which has been published since 1857. This focus is not simply highlighting Postimees as Estonia's oldest newspaper, 
            but also likewise frames our obligation to the company and promise to our readers."A nameplate is a stylized banner on the front of a newsletter or other periodical that identifies the publication.
